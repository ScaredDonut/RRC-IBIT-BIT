# Intro to Business Information Technology: Intro to Programming Logic.

My work for the assignments form the Intro to Programming Logic assignments course. (RRC, IBIT program)

Didn't include any of the scratch assignments because I didn't do them. I didn't think that there was a point of doing the drop and click stuff. 


If you have any questions feel free to PM me, or post a new issue and I will get back to you asap.
